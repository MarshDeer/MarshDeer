# Hi!
<img src=deerpfp.gif style="width: 84px;">

Hi! I'm Lena (She/Her/Deer)<br>
I'm an Artist, Linguist and Translator with formal training in English, Spanish and Japanese translation.<br>

I'm literate in multiple programming languages, but I can only really write HTML, CSS, JS, Bash and some very basic Python.<br>
I'm fluent in Spanish, English, Japanese, Portuguese and Toki Pona, and I'm currently learning Lojban and designing a conlang based on Toki Pona and Sai and Alex Fink's Gripping Language.

I publish most of my projects under the [Opinionated Queer License](https://oql.avris.it/license?c=MarshDeer|http://github.com/MarshDeer).<br>
Feel free to ask if I forgot to add a repo's license, but assume it's under the OQL before using.
