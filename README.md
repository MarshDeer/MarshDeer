# Hi!
<img src=deerpfp4x.png style="max-width:300px">

I'm Lena (She/Her/Deer)<br>
You can learn more about me on [my tumblr's about page](https://lensdeer.tumblr.com/about).

I'm literate in multiple programming languages, but I can only really write HTML, CSS, Javascript and some very basic Python.<br>
I'm fluent in Spanish, English, Japanese, Portuguese and Toki Pona.

I publish most of my projects under the [Opinionated Queer License](https://oql.avris.it/license?c=MarshDeer|http://github.com/MarshDeer).<br>
Feel free to ask if I forgot to add a repo's license, but assume it's under the OQL before using.
